10:T41b,Upon our arrival, the helpers welcomed us with great enthusiasm, followed by last-minute arrangements for the upcoming class to start the week with a joint welcome from Adrian. After a short introduction to iSTEP by Adrian, the children divided into their respective groups. The younger children spent the day with Nadine in the Creative Course, while the adults moved to the conservatory with Hanna for more sewing lessons. Further information on these two courses will be shared in the upcoming posts. The older children focused on the Scratch programming language. The children had independently learned the basics of Scratch over the summer, and our Albanian team members were available on Sunday evenings to answer their questions. This opportunity was well received, sparking engaging discussions and drawing interest from everyone present. To bring all the children up to speed, we conducted a refresher on the material covered. In the coming days, the children will learn more about Scratch and will complete a project of their own by the end.11:T40d,After a brief guest appearance in a class learning about Visual Basic, the Lezha delegation of the iSTEP team (Adrian, Michelle, and Olivia) moves together to GjadÃ«r, to Casa Rozalba I. There, Adrian continues his beginner courses on general computer skills and Excel, which he had previously started online, with the young residents of the children's home. Side by side with the children and the helpers of Casa Rozalba I, we join the vibrant lunch table. Traditional Albanian dishes are served, which vaguely resemble a Swiss pasta casserole and tzatziki. Before lessons continue, everyone takes a break in the house's shared living room. Sister Maggie (actually Margerita, but nobody really calls her that) shares a bit about her career, which brought her from northern India to Albania. Before moving to Albania to support the Casa Rozalba project, she worked with NGOs on aid projects in India, including those for blind people, women receiving new opportunities, and the disabled, for whom, for example, prostheses were organized.9:["$","$Lf",null,{"locale":"en","now":"$D2025-02-07T12:16:02.627Z","timeZone":"Europe/Zurich","messages":{"Navigation":{"projects":{"text":"Projects","link":"projects"},"about":{"text":"About","link":"about"},"ourKnowHow":{"text":"Our Knowhow","link":"ourKnowHow"},"courses":{"text":"Courses","link":"courses"},"blog":{"text":"Blog","link":"blog"},"contact":{"text":"Contact","link":"contact"}},"Footer":{"contactSection":{"title":"Contact"},"donation":{"text":"Thank you for your donations"},"copyright":"iSTEP.
